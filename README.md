# Spout

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wilsonglasser/spout.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/box/spout)


## This version

This fork is a modified version of Spout v3.0, with the ability to add merge cells, comment, formula cells, column dimensions and auto filter for XLSX Writer.

## About

Spout is a PHP library to read and write spreadsheet files (CSV, XLSX and ODS), in a fast and scalable way.
Contrary to other file readers or writers, it is capable of processing very large files while keeping the memory usage really low (less than 3MB).
