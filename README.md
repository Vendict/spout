# Spout

## This version

This fork is a modified version of Spout v3.0, with the ability to add merge cells, comment, formula cells, column dimensions and auto filter for XLSX Writer.

## About

Spout is a PHP library to read and write spreadsheet files (CSV, XLSX and ODS), in a fast and scalable way.
Contrary to other file readers or writers, it is capable of processing very large files while keeping the memory usage really low (less than 3MB).

## Documentation

Sorry but I can't create a documentation for the new methods at the moment.

I will just list the small examples:

* Merge cells *
`$worksheet = $writer->getCurrentSheet();
$worksheet->mergeCells('A1:B1');`

* Row Height *
`$rowStyle = (new StyleBuilder())
    ->setFontSize(10)
    ->setFontName('Arial')
    ->setRowHeight(50)
    ->build();

$writer->addRow(new Row([new Cell('Hello')], $rowStyle));`

* Column Dimension (Width) *
`$worksheet = $writer->getCurrentSheet();
// specific size
$worksheet->addColumnDimension(new ColumnDimension(CellHelper::getCellIndexFromColumnIndex($Column), 50));
// auto size
$worksheet->addColumnDimension(new ColumnDimension(
                'A',
                -1,
                true
            ));`

* Auto Filter *
Enable excel auto filters
`$worksheet = $writer->getCurrentSheet();
$worksheet->setAutoFilter('A1:Z1');`

* Formula value *
Added support to show a calculated value for a formula (Will not calculate, you need to pass the correct value)
`
$Cell = new Cell('=A1', null);
$Cell->setCalculatedValue('100.00');
`

* Number Format *
`$originalValue = 100.0;
$value = 'R$'.number_format($originalValue, 2,',','.');
$style = (new StyleBuilder())
        ->setFontSize(10)
        ->setFontName('Arial')
        ->setNumberFormat(new NumberFormat('0 - "' . $value . '"'))
        ->build();
$Cell = new Cell($value, $style);
// date
$styleMonthYear =  (new StyleBuilder())
    ->setFontSize(10)
    ->setFontName('Arial')
    ->setNumberFormat(new NumberFormat('MM/YYYY'))
    ->build();`

* Comments *
`$worksheet = $writer->getCurrentSheet();
$worksheet->addComment(new Comment('A1', 'My comment', 'Comment user, null for nothing'));`

* Column Index from Cell Index *
Returns the column index (base 10) associated to the base 26 cell index.
Excel uses A to Z letters for column indexing, where A is the 1st column,
Z is the 26th and AA is the 27th.
The mapping is zero based, so that 0 maps to A, B maps to 1, Z to 25 and AA to 26.
`CellHelper::getColumnToIndexFromCellIndex('A1')`
